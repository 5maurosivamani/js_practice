/*
Oops - Object Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming is a paradigm based on concepts of object

How does OOps work?

Create a blueprint then create a new object based on the blueprint

4 Pillars of OOps:-

1. Encapsulation: Data hiding and protection.
2. Abstraction: Hiding the internal details and showing only the necessary information.
3. Inheritance: Reusing code by creating new classes that inherit properties and methods from existing classes.
4. Polymorphism: Same name different implementations.
